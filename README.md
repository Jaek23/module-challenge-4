JavaScript Quiz App

## Description
This is the fourth challenge for the UTA boot camp. This project was created to practice utilizing Vanilla JavaScript. This project was designed to get a better understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and how it interacts with the webpage. Throughout this project, we were focused on applying basic JavaScript functions with methods and properties. 

##Usage 
When you click on the start quiz button the first question will be generated with answer choices. This is quiz timed and will deduct 10 seconds if you select the wrong answer and will display a message saying the answer choice is incorrect. If you click on the correct answer a small text at the bottom of the answers will appear saying you have selected the correct answer. Once you finish the quiz, the page will display your score and an input box to insert your initials to keep track of all scores.
